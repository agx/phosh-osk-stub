phosh-osk-stub (0.20.0~beta1) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido G端nther ]
  * Sync version number with phosh. This makes sure older phosh-osk-stub
    in the archive doesn't replace us.
  * osk-stub: Use g_autoptr for GError
  * Add input-method.
    Move the wayland bits into a separate object
  * Use input-method instead of open coding
  * Move input-surface to lib.
    This allows us to include it in the documentation and separates
    things more from the binary
  * osk-widget: Add key repeat
  * gitlab-ci: Skip doc build when using PKG_ONLY
  * osk-widget: Cancel current symbol in cursor mode.
    Otherwise we emit a space character when space is released after cursor mode
  * osk-widget: Ignore double click.
  * build: Add generated sources to library dependency.
    Otherwise generated files like the DBus headers might not be around
    when compiling pos-osk-stub.c.
  * pos-input-method: Fix typo
  * pos-input-surface: Notify about screen-keyboard-enabled prop changes.
    The property is G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY.
  * pos-osk-widget: Fix doc string
  * pos-input-surface: Drop (for now) unused prototype
  * pos-input-surface: Add getter for 'surface-visible'
  * pos-input-surface: Add getter for 'screen-keyboard-visible' property
  * pos-input-surface: Handle screen-keyboard-enabled gsetting.
    So far we only adjusted the debug surface string.
  * pos-osk-widget: Split setting of layer to separate function.
    This will allow to trigger it from other parts of the code
  * pos-osk-widget: Rename get_layer to get_keyboard_layer.
    This avoids confusion between the Layer enum and the KeyboardLayer
    struct.
  * pos-osk-widget: Rename get_level to get_layer.
    This makes it match the property and the setter.
  * pos-input-surface: Reset keyboard layer when current osk changes
  * pos-input-surface: Reset keyboard layer to normal on fold.
    This makes sure the user dosn't see "random" levels when e.g. switching
    between apps.
  * data: Indicate that we're using feedbackd.
    This will allow configuration tools to pick up that intent.
  * Recreate input surface when it goes away.
    This can happen when e.g. the output with it is unplugged.
  * osk-widget: Allow to parse PosOskKey.
    Allow to parse the key object rather than just plain strings as we
    do in the current layouts. This allows us to wire up tab, etc in
    layouts.
  * vk-driver: Add function keys
  * Add initial terminal layout.
    This lacks menu key, pos1/end, pg-up/pg-down, esc and control
  * data: Add icon to desktop file

  [ InsanePrawn ]
  * vk-driver: Add keycode for ESC
  * terminal: Add ~, TAB and ESC
